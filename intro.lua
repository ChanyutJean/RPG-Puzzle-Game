"Name: Capstone Game"
"Description: With such an inciteful introduction, the game leads you inside a mediocre, pixelated world called Capstone Land, guiding you along an RPG that surely, you have something better to do than this. \n Don't play it."

"Is the world a great place to live?"
"Or does it suck?"
"Or maybe it's more sophisticated than that, and it's a mixture of both?"
"How is life?"
"Is it fun and entertaining, or challenging but cool?"
"Is it filled with happiness, or bittersweet and memorable?"
"Is it bundled with new opportunies, or a polished with classic worklife?"
"Well, with all of that said..."

"I haven't a shred of care about your life."
"Never did, never will."

"Welcome to Capstone Land."
"A land where you can now roam free to whatever your desires meet."
"Where are you?"
"You are here."

-- warps to spawn point --

"Starry: Hi there, new fellow!"
"Starry: You seem to be confused. We're in Crypt Cave, and you've been sent here because you downloaded and initated an app called Capstone Game. Is that right?"

"Yes: continue. No: I'll let you answer that again."

"So, I'm sure you're familiar with how games work. You press the directional pads to move, some other buttons do some mundane stuff, and you beat the boss to win. Easy, right?"

"Yes: continue. No: I'll let you answer that again."

"So, I'm sure you're also aware that you're playing something on your phone right now, and that I'm being really obnoxious right now."

"This game is just some codes, musics, pictures and texts bundled together, so the controls are all at your side. Have fun!"

"Well, that's the plan, but it would probably be wise to travel to Municipality Town to settle down right now instead of wandering aimlessly to 'have fun'."

"Either way, I'll be waiting at the cave exit. See you there!"
